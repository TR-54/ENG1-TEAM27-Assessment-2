        <p>Welcome to <i>Ships 'n' Giggles</i>, a free-to-play pirate adventure 
          game, produced by a small team of indie developers based in York.</p>
        <p>Fun for all ages, <i>Ships 'n' Giggles</i>, plays off the recent 
        cult phenomona of retro-style games, the likes of <i>Among Us</i> and 
        <i>Binding of Issac</i>. By blending the tile-based graphics of nostalgic 
        titles such as <i>Animal Crossing</i> with the action of <i>CoD Dead Ops</i>.</p>

        <!--Assessment 1 Plan-->
        <h4 id="plan1">Assessment 1</h4>
        <p>
          To begin, as a team, we put together an initial plan. This was
          demonstrated with a Gantt chart:
        </p>
        <img src="images/initial-plan.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Gantt chart showing the initial plan to approach the project (not to
          exact dates).
        </p>
        <p>
          We discovered this approach was too detailed and as we began
          completing tasks it became progressively harder to achieve the initial
          goals we set out. Hence, we decided to change our approach to the
          planning and distribution of tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This in turn was done by conducting 4 sprints of 2 weeks each
          adjusting the end goals as required within weekly group meetings on
          Wednesdays:
        </p>
        <img class="" src="images/sprints-overview.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          New updated Project plan with general goals for each sprint
        </p>
        <p>
          We redesigned our project overview to more general goals allowing for
          flexibility among the team. If issues arose or requirements where to
          change, these can be addressed when the team met and weekly plans
          adjusted as needed.
        </p>
        <!--Assessment 2 Plan-->
        <h4 id="plan2">Assessment 2</h4>
        <p>In the first weeks of the project, our team decided on an initial plan
          comprised of 3 sprints of 4 weeks, as outlined in the Gantt Chart below:
        </p>
        <img class="" src="images/initial-plan2.png">
        <p class="caption">
          Gantt Chart depicting initial plan (with generalised dates).
        </p>
        <p>Weekly meetings were held on Fridays, in which group members discussed
          progress on their assigned tasks, and adjustments were made to the plan
          for the upcomming week with regard to task importance.
        </p>
        <p>The Gantt Chat above clearly outlines the plan for the implementation 
        and testing of code however isn't particularly clear on how the report side 
        of the project will be undertook, hence the Gantt Chart below:          
        </p>
        <img class="" src="images/Change Report.png">
        <p class="caption">
          Gantt Chart depicting the teams approach to updating Assessment 1 docs.
        </p>

        <p>Similar to the previous group, we discovered this approach was too 
          ambitious. Quickly finding some requirements too challenging to be 
          adequately implemented within a single sprint, thus extending their
          development into the next sprint.
        </p>
        <p>After realising our current plan was not a good fit for our coding team, 
        we decided on a new plan utilising PDD (plan-driven development). This 
        did not have any notable affect the schedule for the updating of documents 
        displayed in the Gantt Chart above, resulting in the plan diplated by the 
        Gantt Chart below:</p>

            This week, we planned our approach to working as a team and the
            software we would use to achieve this. In addition, the week
            consisted of individually reviewing the assessment brief to get a
            better understanding of the project.

            This week, in addition to continuing research for a game engine and
            project risks, the primary aim was for each member and questions to
            be well prepared for the customer interview planned for the end of
            the sprint.

            logic and UI to have a simple application which displays to the
            user. Furthermore, the overall website design finished at the end of
            this week, allowing for any further documents to be added once

            Sprint 3 had a reduced number of objectives regarding documentation
            to reduce the workload for each member as we were approaching the
            common assessment period. Development continued, focusing on the
            requirements set out in the assessment brief.

            This week, the group had a short meeting to evaluate the current
            prototype and ensure the project was on track to be completed on
            time. Development continued at a slower pace due to ongoing exams.

            development of the game focused on refining areas, including the
            user experience with a reduced number of people working on these
            tasks.

            development reached it's finial stages and was checked by each
            individual to ensure all requirements set in the brief have been

            Additional requirements are updated, mainly consisting of pre-existing 
            bugs. Project, product and business risks updated to reflect any new 
            considerations. All new requirements for assessment 2 are also added 
            to the 'issues' tab, to make it easier for the coding team to check 
            what features have already been implemented and which still need to 
            be completed.
